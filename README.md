These are the datasets that Sonic, Steve and I(Aaron) used in the CIS Summer school research in 2025. 
All datasets were all generated by ourselves using Pythia, Jewel and Fastjet. 
The paper "Finding the Lost Jet Energy: A Monte Carlo Study of Jet Quenching Observables in Collisions at âˆšs=5.36 TeV" was only written by the three of us after our research.
